These are HTTP Rest Scripts that can make testing and executing API calls easier.  These scripts are compatable with the VS Code Extension [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client).

[Rest Client Settings](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient#environment-variables) can be set to create environments and saved in [VS Code Settings](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getstarted/settings/).
